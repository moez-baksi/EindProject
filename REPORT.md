## Challenges
I will shortly describe the major changes I made in my plan.

**Gameplay Changes:**
- Quickly realised there was a major game element missing. It was not a "fun" game, so I decided to change my plan. At first the primary goal was to catch all the pokemon, whereas the secondary goal was to learn some placed on the map. Instead making an application for only the fun, the plan changed to focus more on the Maps API rather than the Pokemon API. Hence the idea for making it a topography learning application. Instead of catching all the pokemon as fast possible, the primary goal changed to remember certain places, using the pokemon API to make it more actractive to the younger students. 
- To make it more stimulating, i decided to change the way i score the students. Instead the of finding as much places in a given time, I instead measure the time passed finding all the places, which serves as a stimulance.
