## Pokémon: learn Topography
#### Try to catch all pokemon as fast as possible
#### Problem tackling: 
A possible treatment for the incurable unavoidable affection called "Bored", whereas it also helps children learning topography.
#### Targeted audience: 
This app is optimized for bored children who like Pokémon, but also need to learn topography. 
#### MVP:
  * Will contain an x amount of Pokémon, depending on the amount of places. I will start with provinces
  * Three screens:
    * Start screen
    * High scores at the end
    * Map (main game)
  * You can catch a Pokémon by tapping on it
  * Pokémon will be randomly assigned a determined spot
  * High scores will be saved, making it more fun to repeat the exercises. 
##### Optional:
  * Online database for the high scores
  * Maybe multiple areas? I will start with provinces, but rivers/large cities is also possible. 
  * Might change the idea into Amsterdam topography for tourists. 
#### Data source?? 
A database of the predetermined locations and a database of high scores.
#### API's:
  * https://pokeapi.co
  * https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
#### Hardest part: 
Some complications might occur while understanding the API of Google maps. 
#### Similar apps: 
Google implemented a similar feature during an event in September 2016.
