## Pokémon 
#### Catch all Pokémon!
##### Throwback to the Google-Maps Event in September 2016, with some modifications.
#### This app lets you catch Pokémon in a specfic area within a specified time limit.
#### Problem tackling: A possible treatment for the incurable unavoidable affection called "Bored".
#### Targeted audience: Bored People who likes Pokémon
#### MVP:
  * Will contain a x amount of Pokémon, depending on the difficulty. 
  * Three screens:
    * Start screen
    * Highscores at the end
    * Map
  * You can catch a Pokémon by tapping on it
  * Pokémon will be on a random spot
  * Highscores will be saved
##### Optional:
  * Online database for the highscores
  * Maybe a reset button
  * Maybe multiple areas? I will start with one (areas like Amsterdam)
  * Not sure if the locations will be hard coded or random (Pokémon might appear in the sea?)
#### Data source?? A database of the Pokémon locations
#### API's:
  * https://pokeapi.co
  * https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
#### Hardest part: 
I think it will be retrieving a map and pinning the locations
#### Similar apps: 
Google did the same thing in September 2016.
