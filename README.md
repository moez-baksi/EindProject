## Pokémon 
## Catch all Pokémon!
##### Throwback to the Google-Maps Event in September 2016.
## This app lets you catch Pokémon all over the world.
## Problem tackling with this app: Too much time.
## Targeted audience: Bored People who likes Pokémon
* MVP:
  * Will contain the original 150 Pokémon
  * Three screens:
    * Start screen
    * list of caught Pokémon
    * world map
  * You can catch a Pokémon by tapping on it
  * Pokémon will always be on the same spot
* Optional
  * The general idea is that the Pokémon will always be on the same spot, so Pikachu will always be on science park, then another possible idea would be to generate random locations if the app is opened. 
  * Maybe a reset button
  * Not sure if the locations will be hard coded or random (Pokémon might appear in the sea?)
* Data source?? A database of the Pokémon locations
* Will use at least two API's:
  * https://pokeapi.co
  * https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
* Hardest part: I think it will be retrieving a map and pinning the locations
* Similar apps: Google did the same thing in September 2016.
