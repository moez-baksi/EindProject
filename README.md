## Pokémon Time Trial
#### Try to catch as much Pokémon as possible within the time limit!
##### Throwback to the Google-Maps Event in September 2016, with some modifications.
#### Problem tackling: 
A possible treatment for the incurable unavoidable affection called "Bored".
#### Targeted audience: 
This app is optimized for bored people who like Pokémon.
#### MVP:
  * Will contain a x amount of Pokémon, depending on the difficulty. 
  * Three screens:
    * Start screen
    * High scores at the end
    * Map
  * You can catch a Pokémon by tapping on it
  * Pokémon will be on a random spot
  * High scores will be saved
##### Optional:
  * Online database for the high scores
  * Maybe a reset button
  * Maybe multiple areas? I will start with one (areas like Amsterdam)
  * Not sure if the locations will be hard coded or random (Pokémon might appear in the sea?)
#### Data source?? 
A database of the Pokémon locations.
#### API's:
  * https://pokeapi.co
  * https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
#### Hardest part: 
Some complications might occur while understanding the API of Google maps. 
#### Similar apps: 
Google implemented a similar feature during an event in September 2016.
