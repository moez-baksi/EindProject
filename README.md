Pokémon# Catch all Pokémon!
### Throwback to the Google-Maps Event in September 2016.
## This app lets you catch Pokémon all over the world.
## Problem tackling with this app: Too much time.
## Targeted audience: Bored People who likes Pokémon
* MVP:
  * Will use at least two API's:
    * https://pokeapi.co
    * https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
  * Will contain the original 150 Pokémon
  * Three screens:
    * Start screen
    * list of caught Pokémon
    * world map
  * You can catch a Pokémon by tapping on it
  * Pokémon will always be on the same spot
* Optional
  * The general idea is that the Pokémon will always be on the same spot, so Pikachu will always be on science park
  * Maybe a reset button
  * Not sure if the locations will be hard coded or random (Pokémon might appear in the sea?)
